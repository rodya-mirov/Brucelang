# Brucelang

Docs TBD because they actually take a long time

You can run this, sort of, by running the `Main` class with arg `whatever.bl` where that's
your source file. It'll do something, if you have it configured right.

Probably best to get a real working `mvn` command that runs this at some point but IntelliJ will
just intuit everything for now.
