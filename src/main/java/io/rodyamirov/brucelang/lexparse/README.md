# Auto-generated code from ANTLR

These files -- everything in this package except this readme -- are automatically
generated by ANTLR from the grammar.

##  DON'T EDIT THESE FILES

Any changes you might make to these files can / will be overwritten frequently.
Consequently, don't edit them -- even just to fix formatting! Especially don't
rename anything because it'll cause compile errors when ANTLR is rerun.

##  DON'T EDIT THESE FILES

I'm not kidding.

### TODO --- Have a CI build step which runs ANTLR and makes sure it causes no code changes.
